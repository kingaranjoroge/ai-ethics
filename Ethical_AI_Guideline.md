# Ethical AI Guideline for Healthcare

## 1. Patient Consent Protocols
- Obtain explicit, informed consent from all patients prior to collecting or processing their data for AI applications.
- Provide clear, accessible information about the purpose, scope, and potential risks of AI-driven data use.
- Allow patients to revoke consent at any time through simple, well-publicized procedures, and ensure prompt cessation of data processing upon withdrawal.
- Maintain records of consent and revocation, and regularly audit consent management processes for compliance.

## 2. Bias Mitigation Strategies
- Conduct regular audits of AI models and datasets to identify and address potential biases, with a focus on demographic fairness and clinical relevance.
- Curate datasets to ensure diverse, representative samples, and document data sources and selection criteria transparently.
- Implement human-in-the-loop review for high-stakes or ambiguous cases, ensuring that clinical experts can override or question AI recommendations.
- Apply algorithmic fairness techniques (e.g., reweighing, adversarial debiasing) during model development and retraining.

## 3. Transparency Requirements
- Ensure all AI systems used in healthcare are explainable, providing clinicians and patients with understandable rationales for recommendations or decisions.
- Publish regular transparency reports detailing AI system performance, error rates, and any adverse events or incidents.
- Maintain comprehensive documentation of model design, data sources, validation procedures, and update cycles, making this information available to relevant stakeholders.
- Clearly communicate the limitations and intended use cases of AI tools to all users, and provide channels for feedback and reporting concerns.
